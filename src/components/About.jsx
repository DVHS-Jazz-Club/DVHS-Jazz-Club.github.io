                        <h3>Our Mission & Vibe</h3>
                        <p>The Dougherty Valley High School Jazz Club is a vibrant, close-knit community of student musicians passionate about jazz. We focus on teaching music theory and improvisation, creating an environment where creativity flourishes and friendships are forged through the universal language of music.</p>
                        <p>It's not a huge club, and we like it that way. Everyone who shows up becomes part of our musical family. Whether you're a seasoned musician or just starting, our club welcomes all skill levels to learn, jam, and grow with us.</p>
